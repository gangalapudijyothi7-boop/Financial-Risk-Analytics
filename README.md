📌 Overview
This project explores how machine learning and statistical techniques can be applied to assess and manage financial risk. It is divided into two major domains:
•	Credit Risk: Assessing the probability of default by borrowers.
•	Market Risk: Analyzing how market variables like stock prices and volatility can affect portfolio value.
The models are built on real-world inspired datasets and processed using Python-based data science tools.

🎯 Objectives
•	Identify key financial features that indicate creditworthiness.
•	Develop models to predict loan default.
•	Analyze market volatility and risk exposure.
•	Compare various machine learning models for classification accuracy.
•	Provide actionable insights for financial institutions and investors.

🔍 Methodologies
📌 Credit Risk Modeling
•	Goal: Predict whether a borrower will default.
•	Techniques Used:
o	Logistic Regression
o	Decision Trees
o	Random Forest
o	XGBoost
•	Steps:
1.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2.	Feature Engineering
3.	Train/Test Split
4.	Model Training
5.	Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC AUC)
📊 Market Risk Analysis
•	Goal: Understand market movements and calculate risk metrics.
•	Focus Areas:
o	Calculating stock returns and volatility
o	Value at Risk (VaR)
o	Correlation analysis among assets
•	Techniques Used:
o	Time Series Analysis
o	Rolling statistics
o	Visualization of trends and anomalies

📈 Results & Insights
•	Identified key indicators that highly influence credit default (e.g., debt ratio, credit history length).
•	Random Forest and XGBoost outperformed logistic regression in credit risk classification.
•	Detected periods of high volatility in market risk dataset corresponding to historical downturns.
•	Value at Risk (VaR) provided quantifiable insights into possible portfolio losses.
